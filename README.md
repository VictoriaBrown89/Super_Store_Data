# Super_Store_Data
-Cleaned and combined store data and created a dashboard in Excel.

SITUATION & TASK:
  - "Super Store" ( needed help determining their sales-to-profit margin for their last fiscal year, drilling down into individual regions, states, teams, products, and salespersons. 
  - The data sets that the company provided needed to be collected and cleaned in order to gain any insights from them. All of the data sets were stored in Excel files, each containing information about some aspect of the business' sales. I determined that the best approach to take was to cleanse the data, combine it, and perform aggregations.

ACTION:
  - I started by creating a VBA script to open each file, format the data as a table, and autosize each row and column. From here, I began cleansing their data, one worksheet at a time. This involved utilizing VLOOKUPs, IFERRORs, splitting several columns of location information, and caluculating profits. 
  - Next, I chose to combine all of the cleansed data into one table, which allowed me to view all of the information together to best determine interconnections within the data.

  - Since all of their data was stored in Excel files, it made sense to utilize a tool that they understood well in order to deliver insights on their data. I created several Pivot Tables and Charts within one worksheet so that I could practice laying out the final product, the dashboard.

RESULT:
  - Finally, I created the dashboard. I used colors and fonts found in the company's style guide. I added slicers so that the company's executives could look into individual state, sales team, and category profits. I also connected the slicers so that the data reflected in all charts and graphs.

  - The executives of Super Store are now able to view the impact that individual states, salespersons, teams, etc. had on their overall profits. Here's a video demonstrating how the dashboard works:
